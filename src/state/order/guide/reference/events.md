# Events

The order store emits one platform event through `EventBus`, from `loadOrder` — and
it is the SDK's only producer of that event.

## `order:completed`

**When:** An order was fetched from the API and put in the store — which happens on
any page opened with `?ref_id=` (success, receipt, upsell). Emitted after the store
is updated, so a listener reading `useOrderStore.getState().order` sees the same
order.

Fires on a fresh fetch only. Reloading the page inside the store's 15-minute window
is served from its cache and emits nothing — see
[order.state.ts](../../order.state.ts) for that window.

**Payload:** the full {@link index.Order} as the API returned it — `number`, `ref_id`,
`lines`, totals, addresses, `order_status_url`.

**Example:**
```ts
window.next.on('order:completed', order => {
  console.log('Thank you for order', order.number);
});
```

### The checkout page does not fire it

An order is *created* on the checkout page but is not necessarily *paid* there.
Express checkout (PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay) and a card payment that needs
3-D Secure all produce an order carrying a `payment_complete_url`, which the SDK
redirects to so the shopper can finish paying — and they can still cancel, or press
back. So nothing is emitted when the order is created: `order:completed` fires on
the page the gateway returns them to, for an order fetched back from the API, which
is the first point at which the money is known to have moved.

If you need to act the moment an order is created, do it in your own submit handler
— the SDK has no event for it. That is deliberate, and
[issue #71](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart/issues/71) is why: an
event raised as the checkout page navigates away gets parked and replayed on
whatever page the shopper reaches next, which is how conversions were reported for
orders nobody paid for.

**It fires on both return legs, so check which one you are on.** A redirect payment
comes back to either `success_url` or `payment_failed_url`, and the platform puts
`?ref_id=` on both — so a declined payment also loads its order and also emits this
event. The SDK's own `dl_purchase` recognises the failure page two ways (the
`?payment_failed=true` its default failure URL carries, and the
`payment_failed_url` path the checkout page recorded), but a listener of your own
sees every `order:completed`. If what you do in it counts as a conversion, read the
order's own payment state — a `payment_complete_url` still on it means the money
never moved — or check the URL.

The SDK's own `dl_purchase` is emitted from here, once per order — see the
[analytics events reference](../../../../core/guide/reference/analytics-events.md).
