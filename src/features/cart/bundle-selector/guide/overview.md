# BundleSelectorEnhancer

> Category: `cart`
> Last reviewed: 2026-04-16 (voucher recalculation in upsell context)
> Owner: campaign-cart

A container that lets a developer define named bundles — each bundle being a fixed set of packages and quantities — and lets a visitor pick one. In swap mode, selecting a bundle atomically replaces the previous bundle's cart items while leaving unrelated cart items untouched. Bundle vouchers are applied and removed automatically as the selection changes.

## Concept

Each bundle is a card element the enhancer registers, tracks, and updates as the cart or prices change. Exactly one bundle is selected at all times. When a visitor clicks a card, the previous card loses its selected state and the new card gains it. In swap mode, the enhancer also writes to the cart — removing all items that belong to the previous bundle and adding the new bundle's items in a single `swapCart` call.

The key difference from `PackageSelectorEnhancer` is that a bundle card can hold **multiple packages** with independent quantities and, optionally, per-unit variant selection. A "3 bottles + free shaker" offer is a single bundle card, not three separate selectable packages.

```
User clicks a bundle card
        │
        ▼
 handleCardClick()
 ├── selectCard()
 │   ├── update CSS classes (next-selected)
 │   ├── set data-next-selected="true"
 │   ├── set data-selected-bundle on container
 │   └── emit bundle:selection-changed
 ├── applyVoucherSwap() — if either bundle has vouchers
 └── mode = swap?
     ├── YES → applyBundle()
     │         ├── strip previous bundle's items from cart
     │         ├── add new bundle's items (tagged with bundleId)
     │         └── cartOperations.swapCart([retained + new])
     └── NO  → wait for external action
```

When a configurable slot's variant changes:

```
Visitor changes variant (select or custom option)
        │
        ▼
 applyVariantChange()
 ├── resolve matching package from campaign data
 ├── update slot.activePackageId
 ├── re-render slots
 ├── mode = swap? → applyEffectiveChange() (cart sync)
 └── fetchAndUpdateBundlePrice()
```

## Business logic

- Exactly one bundle card is selected at all times. There is no "none selected" state after initialization.
- On init, the first card with `data-next-selected="true"` is pre-selected and, in swap mode, its items are immediately added to the cart. If no card has `data-next-selected="true"`, the first registered card is auto-selected and a warning is logged.
- The `?forceBundleId=<bundleId>` URL parameter overrides the `data-next-selected` default. When present, the card whose `data-next-bundle-id` matches the param is pre-selected instead — in swap mode this also writes the bundle to the cart. Format: `forceBundleId=premium` matches any selector; `forceBundleId=tier:premium` scopes to a selector with `data-next-selector-id="tier"`; comma-separated for multiple selectors (`forceBundleId=tier:premium,gift:luxury`). When the bundleId doesn't match any card in this selector, the enhancer falls back to the standard default-selection rules and logs a warning.
- In swap mode, bundle items are tagged in the cart with the selector's `selectorId` (from `data-next-selector-id`). When a different bundle is selected, only the items sharing that `selectorId` are removed; unrelated cart items (upsells, standalone packages) are preserved.
- Vouchers declared on a bundle card via `data-next-bundle-vouchers` are automatically applied when that bundle is selected and removed when it is deselected. Vouchers shared between two bundles are not re-applied or re-removed. User-applied coupons (not bundle vouchers) are always preserved.
- When a bundle card has `data-next-shipping-id`, the specified shipping method is automatically applied after the bundle items are written to the cart in swap mode. Shipping is not applied in upsell context or select mode. If the selected card does not have a shipping ID, the previously set shipping method persists.
- A `BundleItem` with `configurable: true` and `quantity > 1` is expanded into one slot per unit so the visitor can independently choose a variant (size, color) for each unit.
- A `BundleItem` with `noSlot: true` is added to the cart silently without rendering a slot row. Use this for free gifts or add-ons that should not be visible in the slot list.
- Variant selection within a slot resolves a matching package from the campaign store by matching all attribute values. If no package matches the selected attribute combination, the change is logged as a warning and ignored.
- Unavailable variant options (package `product_purchase_availability === 'unavailable'`) are marked with `next-variant-unavailable` and `data-next-unavailable="true"` and are not selectable.
- Price previews are fetched for all cards on init and re-fetched on currency change and on checkout voucher change (both debounced 150ms). Voucher-triggered re-fetches run in both normal and upsell contexts so that coupons applied from exit-intent popups or other sources are reflected in bundle prices on upsell pages. During fetch, the card element gets `data-next-loading="true"` and class `next-loading`.
- When merging bundle-managed vouchers with user-applied coupons for a price fetch, bundle vouchers are sent first and user coupons are appended on top. This ordering affects percentage-based discount stacking.
- Each package state and the bundle price summary store the ISO 4217 currency code used to format their prices. The code is seeded from `campaignStore.currency` on card registration and updated to the currency returned by the price fetch API once the fetch resolves. All price template variables (`{item.price}`, `{item.unitPrice}`, etc.) and bundle display fields (`[data-next-bundle-display]`) are formatted using this stored currency rather than re-reading the store at render time.
- Slot template price variables (`{item.price}`, `{item.originalPrice}`, `{item.discountAmount}`) are always **per-slot** amounts: `unitPrice × slot.quantity`. They are distinct from the bundle aggregate totals shown via `[data-next-bundle-display]`. The calculate API returns per-unit prices (`package_price`, `original_package_price`); slot prices are derived by multiplying those by the slot's own quantity.
- Price comparison uses the campaign package `price_retail` as the compare-at value, not the API's compare total, so savings reflects the true retail-to-current-price difference.
- If a cart write fails (network error or API rejection), the enhancer reverts the visual selection to match the actual cart state.
- Dynamic cards added to the DOM after init are registered automatically via a mutation observer.
- A bundle card carries a `bundleQuantity` multiplier (default 1). Inline stepper controls (`data-next-quantity-increase` / `-decrease` / `-display`) bump it into the range `[minQuantity, maxQuantity]`. The multiplier is applied inside `getEffectiveItems`, so every effective item sent to the cart or to the `/calculate` API is `slot.quantity × bundleQuantity`. Slot rendering is unaffected — a `configurable: true, quantity: 1` item with `bundleQuantity: 5` still renders one variant-picker slot and adds five units of the chosen variant to the cart.
- Bundle-quantity changes write through to the cart in swap mode (only when the card is currently selected) and emit `bundle:quantity-changed` in every mode. The price refetch is debounced 150ms; `bundle:selection-changed` fires alongside so `AddToCartEnhancer` and display bindings refresh immediately.
- Variant changes never reset `bundleQuantity` — the user-chosen multiplier survives a color/size swap on the same bundle.

## Decisions

- We chose to tag cart items with `selectorId` (rather than tracking them by package ID alone) because multiple bundles within the same selector can share the same package. Without the tag, the enhancer could not determine which items belonged to this selector when performing a swap.
- We chose `swapCart` (full cart replace, keeping non-bundle items) over individual add/remove calls because it is a single API round trip and avoids partial-state windows where the old bundle is removed but the new one is not yet added.
- We chose to revert visual state on cart write failure so the UI always reflects the actual cart, preventing a mismatch where the card appears selected but its items are not in the cart.
- We chose `configurable` as a per-item opt-in rather than auto-expanding all multi-quantity items, because most bundles with qty > 1 want a single slot (e.g., "6 bottles of the same product"), and expanding them all into individual slots would require template changes most implementations don't need.
- We chose to debounce currency and voucher re-fetches by 150ms to avoid one price API call per card per rapid change event.
- We chose `bundleQuantity` as a multiplier applied inside `getEffectiveItems` rather than a second axis of slot expansion, because the two intents are orthogonal: per-unit variant picking already has `items[].quantity > 1 + configurable: true`, and a PDP-style "pick one color, buy N" only needs one variant slot + a multiplier. Folding the multiplier into `getEffectiveItems` means every downstream consumer (cart write, price fetch, `_getSelectedBundleItems()`, event payloads, `syncWithCart`) is correct with zero per-site-specific code.

## Limitations

- Does not support multi-select (choosing more than one bundle simultaneously). Use independent `PackageToggleEnhancer` instances per item for additive cart behavior.
- Does not support nested bundle selectors. Placing a `BundleSelectorEnhancer` inside another bundle card is not tested or supported.
- Variant resolution requires that all variant packages for a product exist in the campaign store. If only some variants are included in the campaign, unavailable combinations cannot be detected accurately.
- Slots are re-rendered on every cart store update (when `slotTemplate` is configured). Do not attach event listeners to slot elements directly — they are destroyed on every re-render.
- External slots containers (`data-next-bundle-slots-for`) render only the currently selected bundle's slots. Slots for non-selected bundles are not rendered into the external container.
- Price fetching is asynchronous. Until the fetch resolves, `[data-next-bundle-display]` elements show their initial content. There is no built-in skeleton or placeholder state.
- In select mode, if no external action (button or other enhancer) writes to the cart, the bundle is never applied. The enhancer does not warn when this happens.
- `data-next-bundle-items` does not need to be declared in a card template when using `data-next-bundle-template-id` — the enhancer sets it automatically from the JSON definition. Including `{bundle.items}` in the template is a no-op.
- Inline template strings (`data-next-bundle-template`, `data-next-bundle-slot-template`) require HTML escaping inside attribute values and break syntax highlighting. Prefer `<template id="...">` elements with the corresponding `-id` attributes.
