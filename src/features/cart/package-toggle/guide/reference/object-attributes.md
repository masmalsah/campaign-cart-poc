# Object Attributes

## `PackageDef`

A single entry in the `data-next-packages` JSON array. Defines one card in auto-render mode.

| Field | Type | Nullable | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `packageId` | `number` | no | The `ref_id` of the package this card represents. Must match a package in the campaign store. |
| `selected` | `boolean` | yes | `true` to pre-select (auto-add) this card on init. `null` / absent means not pre-selected. |
| `packageSync` | `string \| number[]` | yes | Comma-separated package IDs (string) or array of package IDs to sync quantity with. Sets `data-next-package-sync` on the rendered card. `null` / absent means no sync. |
| `[key: string]` | `unknown` | yes | Any additional keys are available as `{toggle.<key>}` template variables. The enhancer coerces all values to strings. |

## `ToggleCard`

The internal state the enhancer holds for each registered card. Not directly accessible outside the enhancer, but its shape determines which attributes are read and how the card behaves. All price fields are initialized with provisional values from campaign data at registration time and updated with live values after each price fetch.

**Card identity and state:**

| Field | Type | Nullable | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `element` | `HTMLElement` | no | The DOM element the card is bound to. |
| `packageId` | `number` | no | The `ref_id` of the package this card represents. |
| `name` | `string` | no | Display name from the campaign package. Empty string when the package is not found in the campaign store. |
| `image` | `string` | no | Package image URL from the campaign package. Empty string when not available. |
| `productId` | `number` | yes | Product ID from the campaign package. `null` when not set. |
| `variantId` | `number` | yes | Product variant ID from the campaign package. `null` when no variant. |
| `variantName` | `string` | no | Product variant display name (e.g. "Black / Small"). Empty string when not available. |
| `productName` | `string` | no | Product name from the campaign package. Empty string when not available. |
| `sku` | `string` | yes | Product SKU. `null` when not set on the package. |
| `isPreSelected` | `boolean` | no | Whether the card is pending auto-add. Set to `false` after auto-add fires to prevent repeat adds. |
| `isSelected` | `boolean` | no | `true` when the package is currently in the cart. Updated on every cart sync. |
| `quantity` | `number` | no | The quantity to add to the cart. Dynamically recalculated in sync mode. |
| `isSyncMode` | `boolean` | no | `true` when `data-next-package-sync` is set. Quantity is derived from synced packages rather than a static value. |
| `syncPackageIds` | `number[]` | no | The list of `packageId` values whose quantities are summed to derive this card's quantity. Empty when `isSyncMode` is `false`. |
| `isUpsell` | `boolean` | no | `true` when the package should be classified as an upsell/bump line in the cart. |
| `stateContainer` | `HTMLElement` | no | The closest ancestor element that owns CSS class state (`next-in-cart`, `next-active`, etc.). Defaults to the card element itself when no container is found. |
| `addText` | `string` | yes | Label to show when the package is not in the cart. `null` if not configured. |
| `removeText` | `string` | yes | Label to show when the package is in the cart. `null` if not configured. |
