/**
 * Whether a phone number can be used, and what to store for it.
 *
 * One question, one answer, one place: {@link checkPhone}, or {@link isValidPhone} for
 * callers that only want a boolean. It used to be asked in five places against four
 * yardsticks, so a number could pass one gate and fail the next.
 *
 * Checked in this order, first answer wins:
 *
 * 1. `isValidNumber()` — the phone field's verdict: `isPlausiblePhone` against its
 *    country's phone rules.
 * 2. Digit count, {@link MIN_PHONE_DIGITS}..{@link MAX_PHONE_DIGITS} — `unknown`, never `valid`.
 *
 * Three verdicts because those rules load over the network: `unknown` means nobody could
 * check it, not that the number is wrong.
 *
 * **The bar is deliberately loose, because the order API validates the number.** The field
 * only refuses what is clearly not a phone number: national digits outside the country's
 * loose pattern (`core/country-service/country-service.phone.ts › isPlausiblePhone`), or a
 * number typed with another country's `+` code outside E.164's 8 to 15 digits. It asks
 * nothing about number types or whether a number is in service, so `0000000000` passes in
 * the US and is sent. The two ways of being wrong do not cost the same: refusing a real
 * number loses a sale, silently and for good, while accepting an unreachable one costs a
 * server-side rejection we can see.
