/**
 * The shapes the checkout validator speaks in.
 *
 * A **rule** is one check attached to one field name. A **result** is the verdict on a
 * single field. A **form result** is the verdict on a whole submit, and carries every
 * message at once so the form can show them all rather than one at a time.
 *
 * These live here rather than in `checkout-validator.ts` so the modules that make the
 * verdicts can import them without importing the validator itself. They are re-exported
 * from `checkout-validator.ts`, so existing imports keep working.
