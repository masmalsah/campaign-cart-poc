/**
 * Field mapping constants for checkout form.
 *
 * Four more maps once lived here — `COMMON_FIELD_PATTERNS`, `FIELD_NAME_MAP`,
 * `BILLING_FIELD_MAPPING` and `PAYMENT_METHOD_MAP` — none with an importer.
 * `validation/field-labels.ts` owns the field-label wording, so keeping the
 * copies here only invited them to drift. Removed; this file's history has them.
 *
 * A payment method is spelled three ways — the page's word on the radio, the
 * SDK's word in the checkout store, the API's word on the order — and the two
 * translations between them live here so a method can be added in one place.
 *
 * **Neither translation substitutes anything.** A name that is not in the table
 * comes out unchanged and is sent to the API as the page wrote it, because the
 * API is the authority on what it can charge and this SDK release may simply be
 * older than the method. Substituting a card is what issue #74 was: an iDEAL
 * radio was read as a card, so the order went out as a card, was refused for
 * having no card token, and the shopper was never sent to iDEAL to pay.

/**
 * The page's word for a payment method → the checkout store's.
 *
 * Keys are written with underscores, and a value is normalised (lower case, `_`
 * for `-`) before it is looked up — so `apple_pay`, `apple-pay` and `APPLE_PAY`
 * are one key. Underscore is the spelling the docs give, because it is the one
 * the store and the API use too; a template carrying the kebab form keeps
 * working rather than falling back to the card form.
 *
 * A card answers to two names and no more: `credit`, which is what shipped
 * templates carry, and `card_token`, the orders API's own name, for a caller that
 * has the API value in hand. `card` and `credit-card` are not among them.
 *
 * SEPA Direct Debit answers to exactly one, `sepa_debit`, which is the name the
 * orders API field takes. The platform's payment-methods guide calls the same
 * method `sepa_direct`; that name is deliberately absent, so a page carrying it
 * is warned about and refused by the API rather than quietly working under a
 * second identifier. No shipped page could pay by SEPA before this, so there was
 * nothing to keep compatible (issue #74 asked for the one name).
