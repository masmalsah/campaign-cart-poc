/**
 * Bringing the prospect cart to life on a checkout form, and hearing back from it.
 *
 * A **prospect cart** is a cart recorded on the server from a partly-filled checkout —
 * contact details and the cart lines, no address — so a shopper who leaves can be sent a
 * recovery email. `ProspectCartEnhancer` owns the cart itself; this module owns only its
 * *lifecycle inside the form*: construct it against the form element, start it, and log
 * the two events it dispatches back.
 *
 * It is deliberately failure-tolerant. A prospect cart is a marketing convenience, never a
 * condition of buying, so a start-up failure is logged at `warn` and swallowed rather than
 * thrown — the shopper still gets a working checkout. The half-started instance is still
 * handed back, because `CheckoutFormEnhancer.destroy()` is what tears down the listeners
 * it may already have registered; returning `undefined` on failure would leak them.
 *
 * It is not registered with `AttributeScanner`. Its markup is the same
 * `form[data-next-checkout]` as the form itself, but the scanner never instantiates
 * it — this module does, which is why it exists only where an enhanced checkout form does.
 *
 * Extracted from `checkout-form.enhancer.ts` verbatim. It needs three things from the form
 * ({@link ProspectCartLifecycleContext}).
 *
 * @see [`contact-persistence.ts`](./contact-persistence.ts) — what drives it afterwards:
 * every committed contact field is pushed into the cart from there.
