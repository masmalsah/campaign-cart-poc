/**
 * The banner a shopper sees when a payment is declined — and the guard that stops it
 * announcing itself into an infinite loop.
 *
 * Two halves that share one flag:
 *
 * - **{@link displayPaymentError}** writes the message into the page's credit-error
 *   container, forces it visible, hides it again after ten seconds, and then re-emits
 *   `payment:error` so anything else on the page (analytics, a custom handler) hears it.
 * - **{@link listenForPaymentErrors}** is the other end: payment failures raised *elsewhere*
 *   — express checkout, Spreedly — arrive on the bus and surface in this form.
 *
 * **The display emits the event the listener handles.** Without a guard, the first decline
 * is displayed, its own echo comes straight back to the listener, is displayed again, emits
 * again — unbounded synchronous recursion on the live express-decline path.
 * `announcingPaymentError` is a ref rather than a local so both halves read the *same* flag;
 * it is true only for the duration of that one synchronous emit, which is exactly what tells
 * our own echo apart from a real error raised elsewhere. If you move either half, the ref
 * moves with it.
 *
 * **Which** container it writes into is not this module's decision — see
 * [`payment-error-container.ts`](../utils/payment-error-container.ts), which is
 * shared with the express processor and the card tokenizer so all three name the
 * same element. It is what makes `<method>-error` work for every way of paying
 * rather than for the two the SDK used to hard-code, and what stops a decline
 * being written into a container the chosen method has collapsed shut.
 *
 * Extracted from `checkout-form.enhancer.ts` verbatim. Each half needs a few things from
 * the form ({@link PaymentErrorDisplayContext}, {@link PaymentErrorListenerContext}).
