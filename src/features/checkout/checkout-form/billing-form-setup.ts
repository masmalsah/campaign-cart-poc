/**
 * Builds the billing address form by cloning the shipping one.
 *
 * A page author writes their address fields **once**, for shipping. When the shopper
 * unticks "billing same as shipping", a second full address form has to exist — so the
 * SDK clones the shipping rows, rewrites every field's identity to its `billing-`
 * equivalent, clears the values, and drops the result into the billing container. That
 * rewrite is what {@link convertShippingFieldsToBilling} does, and it is the reason a page
 * needs no billing markup at all.
 *
 * Extracted from `checkout-form.enhancer.ts` as the third cut out of that file. The whole
 * cluster needs only three things from the form ({@link BillingFormSetupContext}) despite
 * being ~170 lines, because it works on the document rather than on the enhancer's state.
 *
 * The **initial** open/closed state is set here too, deliberately without animation — see
 * {@link setInitialBillingFormState}. Animating between states afterwards is
 * `billing-animation.ts`.
 *
 * Everything the billing section looks like on first paint is decided in this file: the
 * fields ({@link setupBillingForm}), whether the section is open ({@link
 * reconcileBillingToggle}), and what is typed into it ({@link
 * restoreBillingAddressFields}).

 *   renders the toggle unticked would otherwise be silently ticked on first paint. The
