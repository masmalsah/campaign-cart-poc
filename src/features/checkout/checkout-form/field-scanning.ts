 * scan misses is a field that is never read, never validated and never submitted, however
 * visible it is on screen; that is the whole reason the scan is one place rather than a
 * `querySelector` in each handler.

 * and `os-checkout-field` (legacy) — because live pages use both.
 *
 * Extracted from `checkout-form.enhancer.ts`. The scan needs four things
 * ({@link FieldScanContext}); the two lookups next to it need one and two, which is why
 * they take their own smaller contexts rather than the scan's.
