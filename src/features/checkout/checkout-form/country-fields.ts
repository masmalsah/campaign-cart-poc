/**
 * Country dropdowns, and the field labels that follow from the chosen country.
 *
 * "State" is not called "state" everywhere — it is a province in Canada, a county in the
 * UK, a prefecture in Japan — and it is not always required. Same for the postcode. So the
 * labels are rewritten from the selected country's config rather than hardcoded in the
 * page, which is why an author writes one address form and it reads correctly wherever the
 * shopper is.
 *
 * Extracted from `checkout-form.enhancer.ts` as the fifth cut out of that file. Grouped by
 * country rather than by "dropdowns" and "labels" separately, because a country change
 * drives both and splitting them would put two halves of one reaction in two files.
 *
 * Choosing *which* states to offer is a separate job — it needs the country service and an
 * in-flight request map — and stays in the enhancer for now.
