/**
 * Putting stored values back into the boxes, and taking them all out again.
 *
 * A shopper who reloads the checkout, walks back a step, or returns from an express
 * payment must see the details they already typed. The checkout store is what remembers
 * them; this module is what puts them on screen. It is the mirror image of the field
 * routing that filled the store in the first place — so the two must agree about names,
 * and about the province dropdown in particular, which cannot hold a value until its
 * country's options have loaded.
 *
 * The opposite job lives here too: {@link clearAllCheckoutFields} empties every box and
 * resets the store, which is what happens after a shopper is warned that their order
 * already went through.
 *
 * Extracted from `checkout-form.enhancer.ts`. Repopulating needs six things
 * ({@link FormPopulationContext}) and clearing needs five ({@link FormClearingContext}) —
 * they overlap on only three, which is why they take separate contexts rather than one
 * shared shape.

/**
 * Writes the stored checkout data back into the form's inputs.
 *
 * Order matters and is the reason this is not one loop. The country goes first, because a
 * province `<select>` can only be given a value once that country's options exist; the
 * generic loop then skips the province for exactly that reason; and the province is set
 * last, after the options have loaded. A phone written straight into the input stays as
 * written until the shopper next edits it — its phone field reads the new text whenever it
 * is asked — and the store is corrected before submit by `phone-normalization.ts`, not on
 * a timer from here.
 *
 * A checkbox or radio is put back through `checked`, never `value` — the store holds a
 * boolean for it, and writing that into `value` would leave the tick exactly as the markup
 * shipped it. That is what made an unticked marketing box come back ticked. Only a value
 * the shopper never gave is skipped; see {@link isStoredAnswer} for why an empty string
 * counts as "never gave".
