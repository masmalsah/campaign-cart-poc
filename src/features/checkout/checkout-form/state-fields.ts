/**
 * The state / province dropdown, refilled whenever the country changes.
 *
 * Countries do not agree on whether a sub-national region exists, what it is called, or
 * whether it is required — so the field is rebuilt per country from what the country
 * service returns, and **hidden entirely** for countries that have neither states nor a
 * requirement. That hiding is the behaviour most worth knowing about: the field a page
 * author wrote is not always on screen.
 *
 * Extracted from `checkout-form.enhancer.ts` as the sixth cut. It is the **most coupled**
 * of the extractions so far and the honest reason is that filling this field is not a
 * self-contained job: it writes form data, clears a validation error, caches the country
 * config, and relabels neighbouring fields. Shipping needs eight things
 * ({@link ShippingStateFieldsContext}); billing needs four ({@link StateFieldsContext}),
 * which is why the context is split rather than one shape with fields billing would have to
 * supply and never use.
