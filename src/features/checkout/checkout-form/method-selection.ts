/**
 * The two radio groups on a checkout page — **how the shopper pays** and **how the order
 * ships** — and what each choice changes.
 *
 * They are one module because they are the same shape of job: a `change` on a radio, a
 * value written into the checkout store, and one side effect on the page. They keep
 * separate context objects because they share nothing — the payment side needs the UI
 * service, the shipping side needs the analytics latch.
 *
 * **Payment method.** The radio's value is the page's word (`credit`, `paypal`,
 * `apple-pay`…); the store's is close to the API's (`credit-card`, `paypal`, `apple_pay`…),
 * so every value goes through {@link toCheckoutPaymentMethod} — which is also what the
 * startup pass reads, so the two cannot disagree about what a radio means. A name the SDK
 * does not know is warned about and then kept, because the API, not this table, decides
 * what can be charged. Any payment error still on the page is hidden — it belonged to the
 * method they just moved away from.
 *
 * **Shipping method.** The radio's value is a shipping method's `ref_id`, and **the
 * campaign says which ids exist, what each is called and what it costs** — the SDK holds
 * no shipping table of its own. The choice goes to the checkout store *and* to the cart,
 * because the cart is what recalculates the totals, and both are written from the same
 * campaign entry so a summary can never quote a price the order will not charge. An id
 * the campaign does not list is refused with a warning rather than written.
 * `add_shipping_info` is reported the first time a method is chosen and never again.
 *
 * Extracted from `checkout-form.enhancer.ts` verbatim; the shipping half has since been
 * fixed — it read a hard-coded table of three ids and two invented prices. Payment needs
 * one thing from the form ({@link PaymentMethodContext}), shipping two
 * ({@link ShippingMethodContext}).

/**
 * Handles a `change` on a payment-method radio.
 *
 * `add_payment_info` is **not** reported here — picking a radio is not committing to pay,
 * and a shopper flipping between methods would report it several times. Each method has its
 * own moment: a card when the card fields are complete (`CreditCardService`), an express
 * method when the button is pressed (`ExpressCheckoutProcessor`), and a redirect method
 * when the form is submitted (`handleFormSubmit`, since nothing about paying is entered on
 * the page).
 *
 * A method the SDK does not know by name is **kept**, not replaced: it is stored as the
 * page wrote it and sent to the API, which is the only thing that can say whether it can
 * charge that way. Replacing it with a card is what issue #74 was — the store held
 * `credit-card` for a shopper who chose iDEAL, and the order was then refused for having
 * no card token, so no order existed to redirect with. The warning is there because the
 * likelier cause is a typo in the markup, and a shopper meeting an API error is a slow way
 * to find that out.
 *
 * A radio with no value at all selects nothing — there is no method to send.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * radio.addEventListener('change', event =>
 *   handlePaymentMethodChange({ ui: this.ui, logger: this.logger }, event)
 * );
 * ```
