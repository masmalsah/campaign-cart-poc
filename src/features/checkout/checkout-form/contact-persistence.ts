/**
 * What happens to the shopper's contact details once they *finish* with a field —
 * remembering them for next time, and telling the prospect cart about them.
 *
 * Three jobs, all keyed off the same moment:
 *
 * - **the prospect cart's email** is kept in step, so an abandoned checkout can be
 *   recovered by the address the shopper actually typed;
 * - **name, email and phone are written to user-data storage**, which outlives the page —
 *   it is what prefills the form on a later visit and what analytics attaches to events;
 * - **the prospect cart is created** as soon as email, first name and last name are all
 *   known.
 *
 * It runs on `blur` and `change` only, never on `input`. That is deliberate: writing on
 * every keystroke would save `a@`, `a@g`, `a@gm` … and create a prospect cart against a
 * half-typed address, which is a recovery email sent to nobody.
 *
 * Extracted from the field-name routing half of `handleFieldChange`. It needs three things
 * from the form ({@link ContactPersistenceContext}) and touches neither the DOM nor the
 * checkout store.
