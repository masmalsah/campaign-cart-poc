# Checkout Form

> Category: `checkout`
> Last reviewed: 2026-08-26

Turns a plain HTML form into a working checkout. You write the markup and name each
input; the feature validates it, collects the card details without them touching
your page, creates the order, and sends the visitor on to the next step.

## Concept

The form is the source of truth for layout, and the feature is the source of truth
for behaviour. It never generates your fields — it finds them.

Everything hinges on **naming**. An input becomes part of the order because it
carries `data-next-checkout-field="email"`, not because of where it sits or what
it is called in HTML. That is what lets a campaign lay a checkout out however it
likes and still submit a correct order.

Card details are the deliberate exception. The card number and CVV are never
inputs you own: the SDK inserts hosted payment fields for them, and what comes
back to your code is a token. That means no card number passes through your
markup, your handlers, or SDK code — which is what keeps a campaign page out of
scope for handling raw card data.

The country group is the other piece of built-in behaviour. Country, state, and
postcode live together inside one container and are revealed as a unit once a
country is known, because the state list and postcode format depend on it. The
billing equivalent is **cloned** from the shipping one rather than hand-written, so
the two can never drift apart.

## Business logic

- **Only a real `<form>` activates.** The feature is registered against
  `form[data-next-checkout]`.
- **Only the submit button submits.** Enter in a field moves focus to the next visible
  field, or closes the keyboard on the last one, and the SDK sets `enterkeyhint` to
  `next` or `done` to label the key, unless the page set its own. A browser would
  otherwise submit on Enter, which from the first field starts express checkout
  unvalidated or flags every empty field (`enter-key-navigation.ts`).
- **Field names are fixed**, not free text — see the reference. An unrecognised
  name is not part of the order at all.
- Some fields are optional by default. `data-next-required="true"` forces
  validation on one; phone is the usual case.
- **A phone number is judged once, and the same way everywhere.** Leaving the
  field, moving to the next step and pressing pay all ask the same question of
  the same phone widget, so a number cannot be accepted by one and refused by
  another. Refused: a number of the wrong length for its country. Accepted:
  everything else, including a number nothing could check, because the widget's
  validation arrives over the network and a shopper is not blocked for a delay
  that is ours. Whether a well-formed number is one anybody holds is the
  server's call, so `0000000000` reaches it and is answered there.
- **The order carries E.164.** What the shopper types nationally
  (`(415) 555-2671`) is stored and sent as `+14155552671`, on the shipping
  address, the billing address and the customer record. Submitting waits, briefly,
  for the phone library to finish loading so there is a number to convert; if it
  never arrives the national number is sent for the API to convert, and the SDK
  logs that it did so.
- **A postcode is rewritten into the shape its country writes it in, while the
  shopper is still typing.** Each country's rules arrive with its data from the
  countries service: a format pattern, a validation pattern, and a minimum and
  maximum length. 47 of the 250 countries ship a format pattern. The field is
  reformatted in place on every keystroke, as well as on change and on blur, and
  the caret is put back where the shopper left it, so `k1a0b1` is written
  `K1A 0B1` in Canada and `sw1a1aa` is written `SW1A 1AA` in the UK. Nothing is
  rewritten before a country is chosen, because the rule belongs to the country.
- **A rewrite is used only when the country's own rule accepts it.** A format
  pattern places its literal characters at fixed offsets, which fits a
  fixed-length postcode when the pattern is filled from the start and a
  variable-length one when it is filled from the end. A UK outward code runs 2
  to 4 characters, so one pattern has to work at three lengths. The SDK builds
  the start-anchored candidate first, then the end-anchored one. A country whose
  postcodes take more than one shape can carry a list of formats rather than a
  single one, and each is tried in turn. It keeps a candidate only if that
  country's own validation pattern accepts it; otherwise the value the shopper
  typed stands, uppercased when it contains letters
  (`core/country-service/country-service.postal-code.ts › formatPostalCode`).
  Two things follow from that. A half-typed postcode is left alone rather than
  rearranged, because a partial value does not satisfy the country's rule yet,
  and it is reshaped once it is complete. And the SDK never submits a postcode
  that its own validation would then refuse.
- Payment methods are declared in markup with short names, written with
  underscores like everywhere else the SDK names one (`credit`, `paypal`,
  `apple_pay`, …); `-` is accepted and case is ignored. The SDK translates them
  to the API's names, so the two vocabularies never have to be reconciled by
  hand. A card is named `credit` here — the full list is in
  [the attribute reference](../../../../../docs/guides/reference/data-attributes.md).
- **The card is chosen before the shopper does anything.** A page that has not
  been touched yet opens its `credit` section, marks it `next-selected` and
  checks its radio, because a card is what the checkout store starts on. On a
  return visit it is the method the shopper last picked that opens instead. Name
  the card section anything other than `credit` or `card_token` and none of that
  happens: the section stays collapsed and the radio is left unchecked, since the
  SDK has no way to tell it is looking at a card.
- **A method the SDK does not recognise is passed through, not replaced.** It is
  sent to the orders API as written and logged as
  `Payment method "…" is not one the SDK knows`, because the API is what decides
  whether it can charge that way — so a method the platform gains after this SDK
  release still works, and a typo comes back as an API error naming it rather
  than as a card form the shopper did not ask for.
- **A redirect method skips tokenization and nothing else.** iDEAL, Bancontact,
  SEPA, TWINT, Swish, Affirm, Link and Klarna collect no payment details here, so
  the form validates, captures the shopper's details and creates the order as
  usual — and then sends the shopper to the `payment_complete_url` the
  API answered with. That URL always wins over a success URL of your own, because
  the order it belongs to has not been paid for yet.
- **Shipping choices come from the campaign, not from the SDK.** A
  `input[name="shipping_method"]` radio carries a shipping method's `ref_id`, and
  choosing it stores that campaign entry's code and price — so a total on screen
  is a total the order will charge. A value the campaign does not list selects
  nothing and logs `Shipping method … is not one this campaign offers`, because
  the campaign cannot price it.
- **A multi-step form is gated by its step number.** Steps 1, 2 and 3 have their
  own rules; any other number is checked against step 2 (contact details and the
  shipping address) rather than waved through, and a step number that is not a
  whole number above zero is read as step 1.
- The order is created **once**, after tokenization succeeds. A declined payment
  produces `payment:error` and no order.
- After the order is created the visitor is redirected using the URL the API
  returns. When that URL is missing, `order:redirect-missing` fires — otherwise
  they would sit on a checkout page for an order that already succeeded.
- **A refusal is shown in the failing method's own container.** Name it for the
  method — `data-next-component="ideal-error"` beside `data-next-payment-method="ideal"`
  — and every refusal of that method is written there, with the message text into
  its `ideal-error-text` child or into the container itself if there is none. A
  method with no container of its own falls back to `credit-error`, which is what
  every page had before this. That fallback belongs **outside**
  `data-next-payment-form`: inside one it is hidden whenever its method is not the
  chosen one, which is why a refused iDEAL payment used to show the shopper
  nothing, and the SDK now moves it out rather than leaving the message unread.
  Changing method clears every one of these containers, since the failure belonged
  to the method they left.
- **The loading overlay stays up until the attempt ends.** It goes up on submit
  and comes down on a redirect or an error, and nothing the shopper does to the
  page in between takes it away — on a phone, the keyboard closing or a tap fires
  a window `focus` event, and an order can take a minute or more. The one thing
  that does clear it early is `focus` returning during an **express** payment
  (PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay): those are paid for off this page, so coming
  back to it means the shopper came back without paying, and the method is reset
  to a card so they can try again. A card or a redirect method creates its order
  here, so the same event says nothing about it and is ignored.
- **The pay button is borrowed, not owned.** It is disabled while the order is
  being placed and put back exactly as it was when the attempt ends — so a button
  your page holds shut until terms are accepted stays shut, and a button that was
  clickable is clickable again after a decline. Give the control a `<button>` or
  an `<input type="submit">`; an `<a>` or a `<div>` cannot be disabled, so it is
  ignored rather than pretended to be held.
- **A "no" is remembered too.** An unticked marketing checkbox comes back
  unticked on reload, not reset to whatever the markup ships. A box the visitor
  never touched is left as the page wrote it.
- The separate billing address survives a reload **as a whole** — the answer goes
  back on the checkbox and the stored address goes back into the fields, so what
  the order will carry is what the visitor can read. Nothing is put back while
  "billing is the shipping address" is ticked, which keeps an address left over
  from an earlier order off a shared browser's screen.
- Legacy `os-checkout-*` attributes are still read as fallbacks, so forms written
  before this convention keep working.

## Decisions

- We find fields rather than render them, because every campaign's checkout looks
  different and a generated form would be overridden immediately.
- We use hosted fields for card data rather than our own inputs, so raw card
  numbers never enter page or SDK code.
- We reveal country, state, and postcode as a group because a state list is
  meaningless before a country is chosen, and a postcode's validation depends on
  it.
- We clone the billing location group from the shipping one instead of asking for
  it twice, so a change to the shipping markup cannot leave billing behind.
- We keep the legacy attribute names working rather than requiring a migration,
  because a half-migrated checkout is worse than a consistent old one.
- We check each formatted postcode against the country's own validation pattern
  instead of trusting its format pattern, because the patterns come from a
  service this repo does not own: a country whose pattern the SDK cannot express
  falls back to the shopper's value rather than producing one that validation
  would then refuse.
- We try the start-anchored candidate before the end-anchored one, because the
  41 countries whose patterns already produced a valid postcode are
  start-anchored, so covering the variable-length ones changed nothing for them.
- We rewrite the postcode on input rather than only on blur, and restore the
  caret, because the browser drops the cursor to the end of the field whenever a
  space is inserted, and a shopper correcting one character in the middle of a
  postcode would then type the rest of it backwards.

## Limitations

- Does not lay out or style anything. No fields appear that you did not write.
- Does not support more than one checkout form on a page.
- Does not own payment method availability — which methods exist comes from the
  campaign and the visitor's device, not from your markup.
- Does not retry a declined payment. It reports the failure and leaves the form
  ready for another attempt.
- Does not announce that an order was created. Express and standard checkout both
  finish through `order:completed`, which the order store emits on the page the
  shopper lands on next — see
  [the order store's events](../../../../state/order/guide/reference/events.md).
- Does not express a format pattern whose literal characters collide with the
  pattern language. `N`, `X`, `A`, `#` and `9` mark the positions a postcode's
  own characters go in, and the pattern language has no escape character, so
  Monaco's `980NN`, Gibraltar's `GX11 1AA`, the Isle of Man's `IMN NAA`,
  Jersey's `JEN NAA` and Lithuania's `LT-NNNNN` cannot be read as written. The
  SDK carries formats of its own for those countries and tries them first, so
  there is nothing to change in your markup. A pattern the SDK has no format for
  falls back to the value the shopper typed.
- Does not write a postcode longer than the country's own maximum length, even
  when that country writes one. An Isle of Man or Jersey postcode with a
  four-character outward code is 8 characters with its space, and both
  countries give their maximum as 7, so `IM991AA` is left unspaced. Typing
  `IM99 1AA` in full is refused by the same length rule, which is a limit of
  the country data rather than of the formatting.
