/**
 * Where a `billing-*` field's value goes.
 *
 * The separate billing address is not part of `formData`. It is its own object on the
 * checkout store, keyed by the names the orders API uses (`first_name`, not `fname`), so
 * every billing field is renamed on its way in — that renaming is this module's whole
 * reason to exist, and it is why a billing value never shows up under the name the markup
 * gave it.
 *
 * Two side effects ride along: the postcode is reformatted for the billing country, and
 * changing the billing country rebuilds the billing province dropdown.
 *
 * One field is not stored as typed. The billing phone goes on the address as the E.164
 * number its phone field assembled, the same rule the shipping phone follows — see
 * {@link readPhoneValue}.
 *
 * Extracted from the field-name routing half of `handleFieldChange`. Three dependencies
 * ({@link BillingFieldRoutingContext}) — the billing field map and the two contexts it
 * passes straight through.
