/**
 * Issue #71: `dl_purchase` fired for orders nobody had paid for.
 *
 * `ExpressCheckoutProcessor` emits `express-checkout:completed` the moment the
 * orders API accepts a PayPal order — one redirect *before* the customer pays —
 * and the event was then parked in sessionStorage and replayed on the next SDK
 * page in the session. Pressing back from PayPal, or landing on
 * `payment_failed_url`, therefore reported a purchase that never happened; a
 * merchant's affiliate network approved six payouts against it.
 *
 * These tests read `window.NextDataLayer` rather than a mocked `dataLayer.push`,
 * because the once-per-order rule lives inside `push` — it has to, so that an
 * event replayed from the queue after the redirect is deduped too.
 *
 * They cover one half of the guarantee: what the analytics wiring does with the
 * events it is given. The other half — that the checkout page emits no
 * `order:completed` when it *creates* an order, so the order store is the only
 * producer — is `src/tests/contract/purchase-producer.test.ts`. Both are needed:
 * gating alone let #71 through once already.
