/**
 * Finding 45: `blockedEvents` reaches only GTM and Facebook because their
 * constructors are the only ones that accept it and forward it to the shared
 * `ProviderAdapter` base (which does the actual filtering in `trackEvent`).
 * NextCampaign, RudderStack and Custom must accept the same option so a page
 * that blocks an event gets it suppressed everywhere, not just two of five
 * destinations.
 *
 * `ProviderAdapter.trackEvent` checks `blockedEvents` before ever calling
 * `sendEvent`, so a passing adapter here never dispatches for a blocked event
 * name — asserted by spying on `sendEvent` directly rather than on a
 * provider-specific side effect (script loading, fetch, etc.).
