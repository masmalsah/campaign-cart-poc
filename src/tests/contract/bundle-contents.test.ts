/**
 * Production-bundle contract.
 *
 * `src/docs/` is build-time documentation machinery — the declaration/prose
 * content, and the renderers and extractors that turn it into the core reference
 * pages. It carries long prose strings.
 *
 * None of it may reach a customer page. Tree-shaking removes all of it, but nothing
 * asserted that, so the guarantee was one stray runtime import away from silently
 * ending — and the symptom would be a bundle tens of kilobytes larger, which no
 * existing test or gate would notice.
 *
 * This test was the gate for moving that machinery out of `core/` and stays the gate
 * against it creeping back in.
 *
 * ## What it reads
 *
 * Every JavaScript file `npm run build` emits into `dist/`:
 *
 * - `dist/index.js` and `dist/styles.js` — the two ES entries;
 * - `dist/chunks/*.js` — the ES chunks, **the files a campaign page actually
 *   fetches**;
 * - `dist/index.umd.js` — the single-file UMD fallback.
 *
 * It deliberately does not read `dist/loader.js`: that is copied verbatim from
 * `public/loader.js` by the `build` script and is hand-written, not build output.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-02 only the UMD was scanned, which left the gate blind to exactly
 * the case its own comment claimed to guard — the docs layer sitting in a sibling
 * chunk.
 *
 * ## What it cannot prove
 *
 * `dist/` is committed, and this test asserts on whatever is committed — not on a
 * bundle built from the current working tree. `.github/workflows/build.yml` runs
 * `bun run test:coverage` **before** `bun run build`, so in CI it always reads the
 * `dist/` that came with the checkout. A change that adds a runtime import of the
 * docs machinery therefore goes green here and only starts failing once someone
 * rebuilds and commits `dist/`. Treat a pass as "the artifact we ship today is
 * clean", not "the source we just wrote is clean". The tests below make that
 * failure mode loud in one direction at least: they fail if the ES chunks are
 * missing, so a `dist/` with no chunk output cannot pass by scanning nothing.
