/**
 * ES-bundle initialisation contract.
 *
 * `dist/index.js` plus the chunks beside it are what `public/loader.js` fetches for
 * every browser that supports modules — almost every visitor. If evaluating that
 * module graph throws, the loader's `catch` quietly loads `dist/index.umd.js`
 * instead, so the page still works and nothing fails loudly: every visitor just
 * downloads both bundles and gets a console error. That shipped in v0.4.31 and was
 * only found by a human reading the console
 * ([#77](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart/issues/77)).
 *
 * The cause is always the same shape. `manualChunks` splits `src/` into chunks that
 * import each other in cycles; ES modules evaluate one side of a cycle first, so a
 * module-scope call across the boundary — and `const logger = createLogger('X')` at
 * module scope is that, in dozens of files — can land in a `class` the other chunk
 * has not evaluated yet. The result is `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'l' before
 * initialization`, in minified code, on a line no source map explains. Nothing else
 * in the suite sees it: every unit test imports `src/`, where the chunk boundaries
 * do not exist.
 *
 * So this test evaluates the built graph the only way that proves anything — by
 * running it. A child `node` process gives the real ES-module semantics of a
 * browser (the same evaluation order, the same temporal dead zone), with happy-dom
 * supplying the browser globals the SDK touches while its modules initialise.
 *
 * ## Why it evaluates the graph more than once
 *
 * Module-init work is often behind a flag, so one evaluation only proves the graph
 * is safe on the boot it happened to take. `?debugger=true` is the flag that
 * matters: the `debug` chunk holds nine statically-imported modules, and what its
 * module bodies *do* changes with the flag. v0.4.35 through v0.4.37 threw
 * `Cannot access 'o' before initialization` on every debug page load and this test
 * was green throughout, because it only ever loaded `https://campaign.test/`
 * ([#93](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart/issues/93)).
 *
 * So `BOOTS` below lists every input that changes what runs at module-init time,
 * and each one gets its own child process. Add a row whenever a module body starts
 * branching on something new.
 *
 * ## What it cannot prove
 *
 * Two limits, both worth knowing before trusting a pass:
 *
 * - **It reads the committed `dist/`, not a build of the working tree.** `dist/` is
 *   committed and `.github/workflows/build.yml` tests before it builds, so a source
 *   or `manualChunks` change that reopens this goes green until someone rebuilds and
 *   commits `dist/`. Unlike the docs-marker
 *   gate next door, that is only half a weakness here: the committed `dist/` *is*
 *   the artifact jsDelivr serves from the tag, so a pass is a true statement about
 *   what customers load today. Rebuild `dist/` before trusting it about your edit.
 * - **Module init is not the whole boot.** The SDK's own initialisation is async and
 *   needs an API key and a campaign; it fails here, by design, with
 *   `[SDKInitializer] SDK initialization failed`. That is expected output, not a
 *   failure — this test only asserts that evaluating the graph does not throw.
 *   `e2e/es-bundle.spec.ts` covers the real boot in five real engines.
