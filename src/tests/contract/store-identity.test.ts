/**
 * Store-identity + persistence contract for `state/`.
 *
 * Every store lives in `state/<domain>/`, reachable either through the folder's
 * barrel or by importing the `.state.ts` file inside it. Two things can break
 * silently when those files move, and neither shows up in `type-check`:
 *
 * 1. **Two instances.** If a barrel ever re-declares a store instead of
 *    re-exporting it — or a second copy of the module is reachable by another
 *    path — callers split across two Zustand stores. Writes on one are invisible
 *    to the other: every unit test still passes, and the live page splits its
 *    cart or checkout state in half.
 * 2. **A changed `persist` key.** The key names a live entry in a visitor's
 *    sessionStorage. Rename one and every session in flight loses its cart,
 *    checkout form, or order.
 *
 * (This test was written for the `state/<domain>.state.ts` → `state/<domain>/`
 * move and asserted the old-path shims resolved to the same instance. The shims
 * are gone; it now guards barrel-vs-direct, which is the same failure mode.)

 *
 * Every persisted store is scoped as of 0.4.34. `attribution` was the last holdout —
 * the argument for sharing it was that an affiliate who sends a shopper to one funnel
 * should keep the credit when they buy on another. It is scoped now anyway, so that
 * credit follows the funnel. The separate `evclid`, `next_utm_data` and `tn_tag_*`
 * copies stay origin-wide, so a click id captured on one campaign is still readable
 * from the next.
 *
 * The suffix is present only because the `vi.hoisted` block above put a
 * `next-api-key` on the page first. A page with no readable key writes the **bare**
 * name instead — the pre-scoping behaviour, and deliberately not what this asserts.
