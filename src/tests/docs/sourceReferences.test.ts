/**
 * Every source citation written by hand actually points at something.
 *
 * The generated pages cite the enclosing symbol and are checked by their own drift tests
 * (`source-anchor.ts` and `documentation-plan.md` §0a). **Hand-written prose is the half
 * nothing checked.** Those citations are literal strings that no generator rewrites, so
 * when the code moves they do not fail — they just quietly start lying, which is worse
 * than a gap because a reader trusts a specific file and line.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: moving `checkout-form.enhancer.ts` into its feature folder
 * left `core/guide/subsystems/test-mode.md` citing a path that no longer existed, and
 * every gate stayed green.
 *
 * Two rules, both aimed at that failure:
 *
 * 1. **A cited file must exist.** Applies to every form, and it is what catches a move.
 * 2. **A cited symbol must be in that file.** Applies to the `file › Symbol` form, and it
 *    is what catches a rename.
 *
 * Line-number citations (`file.ts:412`) get rule 1 but cannot get rule 2 — the number is
 * a property of the formatting, not of the code, so there is nothing stable to verify it
 * against. They are counted instead, against a ceiling that may only ratchet **down**:
 * every one converted to `file › Symbol` is a citation that starts being checked properly.
