/**
 * Generates `src/core/guide/reference/javascript-api.md` and `window-surface.md`, and
 * fails when the committed markdown, the prose declaration, or the source drift apart.
 *
 * Regenerate:
 *   UPDATE_DOCS=1 npx vitest run src/tests/docs/nextMethods.test.ts
 *
 * A test rather than a script because the declarations load through Vite, so
 * TypeScript and `@/` resolve with no build step.
 *
 * What this is actually guarding against, in order of how much it cost last time:
 *
 *  1. **A public method nobody documented.** Seven of them — `swapCart`,
 *     `getVersion`, `triggerCallback`, `createVariantKey`, and the three variant
 *     lookups — were reachable as `next.*` and absent from the published list. The
 *     forward-direction check below is the test that would have caught them.
 *  2. **A row for a method that no longer exists.** The reverse direction.
 *  3. **A TSDoc block that is only `@category`.** Thirty-four of the 65 members had
 *     one: a heading to file the member under, and not one sentence. That publishes
 *     nothing, so it counts as undocumented here.
 *  4. **A `window.*` global installed and never written down.** `nextDebug` alone
 *     carries ~50 keys including all six raw stores.
