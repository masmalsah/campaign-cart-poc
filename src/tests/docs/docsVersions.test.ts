/**
 * Drift check on the docs site's version index.
 *
 * `docs/site/versions.json` is the directory the in-page version switcher reads, and it
 * is **generated** — `scripts/docs-versions.mjs` derives it from the repository's release
 * tags plus `package.json`'s `version`. This test is what stops it from becoming
 * hand-kept.
 *
 * Regenerate:
 *   npm run docs:versions
 *
 * Two directions are checked, and both matter:
 *
 * 1. **The generator's own output is well-formed** and its newest entry agrees with
 *    `package.json`. That runs on a bare checkout with nothing built, which is the state
 *    CI is in — so the contract is enforced even when no site exists.
 * 2. **A committed/built `versions.json`, if present, equals what the generator
 *    produces.** A stale file is the failure that actually reaches a reader: the switcher
 *    would offer versions that were never built, or hide the release they are on.
 *
 * The script is run as a subprocess rather than imported. It is a plain `.mjs` with no
 * type declarations, and running the real CLI also covers its argument handling — which
 * is what a human invokes.
