   * one: an express checkout (PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay) and a card payment
   * needing 3-D Secure both leave the checkout page with the money still unmoved,

   * `?ref_id=` on both, so the order loads either way. The SDK's own
   * `dl_purchase` tells the two apart; a listener of your own must check for
