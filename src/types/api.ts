/**
 * A placed order, exactly as the orders API returns it — its lines, totals,
 * shipping, addresses, and the URLs the shopper is sent to next.
 *
 * This is **the order object the SDK holds**: creating an order, fetching one by
 * `ref_id`, and adding a post-purchase upsell all resolve to it, and it is what
 * the order store ({@link useOrderStore}) keeps on a receipt or upsell page.
 * Read it when you need any total, line, or address.
 *
 * {@link OrderData} is a smaller, older view of this same object — six fields
 * plus loosely typed `lines`/`user` — and is only the declared payload type of
 * the `order:completed` event. At runtime that event delivers a full `Order`.
 *
 * Every money field is a decimal **string** in the order's `currency` (`"59.98"`),
 * not a number, so it survives JSON without rounding. Parse it before doing
 * arithmetic.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { useOrderStore, type Order } from '@next-commerce/campaign-cart';
 *
 * const order: Order | null = useOrderStore.getState().order;
 * if (order) {
 *   console.log(order.number, order.total_incl_tax); // "NX-10428" "59.98"
 *   const upsells = order.lines.filter(line => line.is_upsell);
 *   console.log(`${upsells.length} upsell line(s) added after checkout`);
 * }
