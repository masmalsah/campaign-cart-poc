 * they are read straight out of it by
 * `src/docs/extract/extract-analytics-events.ts`. What is left over is judgement:
 * when an event fires in product terms, what a field means to the business rather
 * than to the compiler, which provider quietly reshapes or drops it, and what to
 * do when a configured provider receives nothing. That is what lives here.
 *
 * `src/tests/docs/analyticsReference.test.ts` checks this file against the
 * extractor in both directions, so a new event cannot stay undocumented and a
 * removed one cannot keep its row.
 *
 * Build-time only, like the other manifests in this folder: nothing under `src/`

Until 2026-08-05 the event fired at creation time and was then replayed on the next page in the session, so pressing back from PayPal — or landing on `payment_failed_url` — reported a purchase for an order that never existed, with a fabricated `order_<timestamp>` transaction id ([issue #71](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart/issues/71)).

Nothing is reported there: the checkout page records both paths (`nextDataLayer_checkoutReturnPaths`) so the landing page can tell them apart, and `?payment_failed=true` — the SDK’s default failure URL — is treated as a failure on its own. The recorded success path outranks that parameter, because a flag can arrive on a page by routes the SDK does not control: a shopper who cancelled PayPal and then paid by card was landing on the success page with a leftover `?payment_failed=true`, and lost the purchase event for an order that had been paid for ([issue #90](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart/issues/90)).
