 * Every URL query parameter the SDK acts on, and what adding it to a link does.
 *
 * These are the switches nobody can find. They are not in the HTML, so grepping a page
 * never turns them up; they are not owned by a feature, so no feature page documents them.
 * The result is that `?ignore=true` quietly stops a session from being tracked, and
 * `?test=true` puts a live checkout into a mode that posts a fake card to the real order
 * API — both undocumented until this page.
 *
 * The parameter **names** are checked against the source by
 * `src/tests/docs/coreContracts.test.ts` in both directions, so a parameter added to the
 * code and not to this list fails, and a parameter listed here that nothing reads fails.
 * The judgement — what it is for, whether it is safe on a live page, what it does *not*
 * do — is hand-written, because that is what a reader actually needs and no extractor
 * can infer it.
 *
 * Build-time only: nothing under `src/` may import this.
