/**
 * The **inventory** of author-facing core subsystems — the denominator the coverage
 * gate measures core against.
 *
 * Why an inventory at all, when `src/core` is 75 files: neither of the obvious
 * denominators works. **By file** is wrong because 37% of core's lines are the debug
 * overlay and two files are dead, so the number would move for reasons a reader does
 * not care about. **By exported symbol** is worse — 228 exports at 43% TSDoc coverage
 * would improve by writing TSDoc that lands on a class page. Those pages are published
 * (`src/core` is a TypeDoc entry point since 2026-07-31), but they answer a
 * contributor's question, not the question of someone building a page. So the unit is
 * the **contract a page depends on**, and the rows below are the parts of the engine an
 * author can configure, call, subscribe to, or observe.
 *
 * Prose deliberately lives elsewhere — `src/core/guide/subsystems/<id>.md` per row.
 * See {@link ./core-manifest.CoreSubsystem}.
