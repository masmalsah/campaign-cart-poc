/**
 * The typed contract of a **core subsystem** — one author-facing part of the SDK's
 * engine, and the pages that document it.
 *
 * Nobody activates the boot sequence and it has no fields. What core has is
 * **contracts** — what boots in what order, what it reads off the document, what it
 * writes to storage, what it prints to the console, and which switches an author can
 * flip.
 *
 * That distinction is why calling core "internal" is only half true: the *classes* are
 * internal and free to move, the *behaviour* is depended on by every campaign page. An
 * author never imports `SDKInitializer`, and absolutely depends on what it does.
 *
 * **This file is inventory, not prose.** The judgement — the mental model, the domain
 * rules, the traps — lives in `src/core/guide/subsystems/<id>.md`, one file per
 * subsystem. Keeping the prose out of here is deliberate: a single shared TypeScript
 * literal is the one shape that cannot be written by several people at once.
 *
 * **Build-time only.** Nothing under `src/` may import this — it carries
 * documentation, and a runtime import would ship every description in the bundle that
 * loads on customer landing pages.
 */
