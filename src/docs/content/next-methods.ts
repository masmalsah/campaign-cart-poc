 * The prose half of the scriptable-API reference: what every `next.*` call is for,

 *
 * The names, signatures and source lines are **not** here — they are read out of
 * `src/core/next-commerce/next-commerce.ts` by `src/docs/extract/extract-next-methods.ts`, and a
 * drift test compares the two in both directions. So a method added to the facade
 * cannot stay undocumented, and a row for a deleted method cannot survive.
 *
 * Why a hand-declared file at all, when the class already carries TSDoc: TSDoc on the
 * class publishes to the **class page** — `src/core` is a TypeDoc entry point since
 * 2026-07-31, so it does reach a reader, but that reader is a contributor browsing
 * symbols. Someone wiring up a page looks for a task-shaped reference with runnable
 * examples, and that has to live somewhere a generator can write markdown from — this
 * file. Same pattern as {@link SDK_ATTRIBUTES} in `sdk-attributes.ts`.
 *
 * Build-time only, like every manifest: nothing under `src/` may import this, or
 * every sentence below ships in the bundle a customer page downloads.
