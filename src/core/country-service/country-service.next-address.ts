/**
 * The next-address Worker as this SDK's source of country and address rules.
 *
 * Replaces the two `cdn-countries` endpoints `CountryService` used to call. Everything
 * built on top of them — the localStorage cache, the campaign/config country filtering,
 * the postcode formatter — is unchanged: this module only fetches and translates.
 *
 * The API is public, `GET`-only and unauthenticated; see `docs/http-api.md` in the
 * next-address repo. Four routes carry everything this SDK asks for:
 *
 * | Route | Answers |
 * |---|---|
 * | `GET /v1/geo?include=rules,states` | the visitor, and the rules and states of the country they are in |
 * | `GET /v1/countries` | the country list |
 * | `GET /v1/countries/:country?include=states` | one country's rules and states |
 * | `GET /v1/locales/:lang` | the message templates, in one language |
 *
 * Only the first depends on the visitor, so the first three of `LocationData`'s requests
 * go out together and two of them come from the edge cache. `geo` carries the visitor's
 * currency and IP alongside their country. The currency is a reading of where the visitor
 * is, not an instruction about what to charge: the SDK uses it as the lowest-priority
 * default, under `?currency=` and the choice saved for the session.
 *
 * No `currencySymbol` is served and none is needed — prices are formatted by
 * `core/currency-formatter.ts` through `Intl.NumberFormat`, which derives the symbol from
 * the code.
