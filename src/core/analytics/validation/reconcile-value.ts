/**
 * Revenue reconciliation — single source of truth.
 *
 * Verifies that `ecommerce.value` follows the GA4 rule, shared by the runtime
 * EventValidator and the debug EcommerceEventValidator so it can never drift.
 *
 * GA4 spec (recommended events, online sales) is unambiguous and applies to
 * EVERY event, purchase included:
 *
 *   "Set `value` to the sum of `(price * quantity)` for all items in `items`.
 *    Don't include `shipping` or `tax`."
 *
 * So the rule is simply: value === Σ(item.price × item.quantity). `tax` and
 * `shipping` are reported in their own fields and are NEVER part of `value`.
 *
 * When reconciliation fails, we diagnose the most common cause — a `value` that
 * wrongly folds in shipping and/or tax (the grand-total mistake) — so the fix is
 * obvious rather than just "numbers don't match".
