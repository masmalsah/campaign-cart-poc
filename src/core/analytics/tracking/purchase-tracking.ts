/**
 * The two questions every automatic `dl_purchase` has to answer first: *did the
 * customer actually pay*, and *has this order already been reported*.
 *
 * Both exist because of issue #71. `dl_purchase` was hung on the event the
 * express-checkout processor fires the moment the orders API accepts a PayPal
 * order — which is **before** the customer has paid anything: that order comes
 * back with a `payment_complete_url` and the SDK redirects to PayPal with it.
 * The event was then parked in `sessionStorage` (`_willRedirect`) and replayed on
 * the next SDK page in the session, so pressing **back** from PayPal, or landing
 * on `payment_failed_url`, fired a purchase for an order that never happened. One
 * merchant's affiliate network approved six payouts for purchases that did not
 * exist.
 *
 * So an order is only reportable once it is paid, and only once ever:
 *
 * - {@link isAwaitingGatewayPayment} — a `payment_complete_url` means the money
 *   has not moved yet. True for every express method (PayPal, Apple Pay, Google
 *   Pay) at creation time, and for a card order that needs 3-D Secure. Those
 *   orders are reported later, when the gateway returns the shopper to
 *   `success_url?ref_id=…` and the order store loads the paid order.
 * - {@link hasPurchaseBeenReported} — identity is the transaction id. There is one
 *   producer now (`order:completed`), and it can fire for the same order more than
 *   once: a receipt link reopened in a new tab, or a reload after the order
 *   store's 15-minute cache has expired, both fetch the order again.
 *
 * The dedupe list lives in **localStorage**, not sessionStorage, for exactly that
 * new-tab case: a new tab is a new session, and re-reporting the order there is
 * the double-count this prevents.
 *
 * A caveat the failure-leg check cannot escape: it compares **paths**, not full
 * URLs. A merchant whose `payment_failed_url` sits on a different host but the
 * same path as their success page would have real purchases vetoed. Comparing
 * origins too would fix that and break something worse — a `www` / non-`www`
 * mismatch would stop vetoing the real failure page, which is a phantom purchase,
 * and #71 is the reason phantom purchases outrank missing ones here. The veto logs
 * an info line whenever it fires, so a merchant chasing missing conversions can
 * find it.
