# TypeScript Conventions

## Path Aliases
Always use path aliases — never relative `../../` imports across module boundaries:
- `@/` → `src/`
- `@/types/` → `src/types/`
- `@/utils/` → `src/utils/`
- `@/state/` → `src/state/`
- `@/features/` → `src/features/`
- `@/api/` → `src/api/`
- `@/core/` → `src/core/`

That is the complete list, from `tsconfig.json` `paths` (mirrored in
`vite.config.ts`). There is no `@/stores/` or `@/enhancers/` alias — those folders
were renamed to `state/` and `features/`, and an import using the old alias does not
resolve.

Relative imports (`./foo`, `../bar`) are fine within the same directory or one level up inside a feature folder.

## File Naming

Files are **kebab-case with a dotted role suffix**: `<name>.<role>.ts`.

- Roles: `enhancer`, `handlers`, `renderer`, `types`, `state`, `slice`, `api` — e.g. `add-to-cart.enhancer.ts`, `cart.state.ts`, `coupon.slice.ts`.
- A feature that outgrows those four layers may add a role naming **what the file
  computes**, as long as it already exists somewhere in `src/features/`: `price` (money
  maths), `properties` (turning a `{object}.{property}` path into a value), `conditions`
  (evaluating a condition to a boolean), `dependencies` (deciding which stores a feature
  must subscribe to), `cards` (finding and registering the DOM cards a selector binds to),
  `styles` (a CSS string the feature injects). Prefix the role when one file per domain is
  clearer than one big file — `conditional-display.order-properties.ts`,
  `order-display.line-properties.ts`. Do not invent another name for a job one of these
  already describes; two features naming the same job differently is what makes a layout
  unlearnable.
- Two roles do **not** mean what they look like, and both have bitten a refactor:
  - `state` inside a feature folder is *derived state*, not a Zustand store
    (`bundle-selector.state.ts` builds a view model). Stores live in `src/state/`.
  - `display` in `features/cart/` is **a second, DOM-activated enhancer** —
    `package-selector.display.ts` exports `PackageSelectorDisplayEnhancer`, which
    `AttributeScanner` registers for `data-next-display="selector.…"`. It is *not* the
    "state → DOM" layer that the same suffix means in `features/display/`. Do not put a
    layer helper in one of those four files; a cart-state reconciler that writes to the
    cart belongs in `handlers`, and a read-only one in `renderer`. Those four enhancers
    are also invisible to `npm run docs:coverage` because it scans `*.enhancer.ts`.
- Folders are kebab-case too (`features/cart/add-to-cart/`).
- `index.ts` stays `index.ts` (barrel — exports only).
- **Kebab governs the file name only.** Identifiers inside keep normal JS casing: classes/types PascalCase (`AddToCartEnhancer`, `CartState`), functions/vars camelCase.

Why kebab (not PascalCase/camelCase): it is case-safe on case-insensitive filesystems (macOS/Windows), so an import can't break on a wrong capital, and it stays uniform with the dotted role suffixes. Existing PascalCase enhancer files and camelCase store files are legacy — they move to this scheme during migration (see the `sdk-structure` skill).

## Strict Mode Rules
The project uses TypeScript strict mode. Follow these:
- No non-null assertions (`!`) — use optional chaining (`?.`) or explicit null checks
- Prefer nullish coalescing (`??`) over `||` for default values
- Prefer optional chaining (`?.`) over manual null checks
- No `any` unless truly unavoidable; prefer `unknown` with a type guard. There is no shared
  guard module: `src/utils/typeGuards.ts` had 23 exports and zero callers and was deleted
  2026-08-02. Write the guard where it is used, or factor one into `src/utils/` if a second
  call site appears
- No unused variables — prefix intentionally unused params with `_`

## Dead-code gates
`tsconfig.json` sets `noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters` to `false`, so the compiler never
reports a dead import, local, or parameter on its own. Two ratcheted gates cover what that
leaves open — both frozen-baseline scripts, same shape as `type-check-tests.mjs`:
- `npm run check:unused` — unused locals/parameters/imports (`scripts/check-unused.mjs`),
  via `tsconfig.unused-check.json` with those two flags turned on for this run only.
- `npm run check:unused-exports` — unused *exports*: a named export nothing in
  `src/`/`e2e/`/`scripts/` imports (`scripts/check-unused-exports.mjs`). This is the gap the
  first gate cannot see — `noUnusedLocals` only inspects a binding inside its own file, never
  whether another file imports it. It is a hand-rolled TypeScript-AST scanner, not ts-prune or
  knip: both were evaluated and knip silently returned zero findings on this repo's full tree
  (see the script's header comment for the reproduction). `src/index.ts` and `src/styles.ts`
  (the two real build entries) are exempt by design, as is anything only reachable through a
  computed `import()` path — see the header comment before adding a third exemption.

Run `npm run check:unused-exports:update` (or `check:unused:update` for the sibling gate) to
re-freeze the baseline after a deliberate change to what is tolerated, with a `notes` entry
saying why. **`:update` freezes whatever the tree reports at that moment**, including findings
another agent's half-finished edit just created — diff the baseline against `HEAD`'s copy before
committing, and note anything you did not judge yourself.

### Clearing an unused export

Three outcomes, in order of preference:

1. **Drop the `export` keyword.** The default when the symbol still has callers inside its own
   file. The code stays, the module surface shrinks, and nothing a generator reads changes —
   the file, the symbol name, and every string literal are untouched, so a source anchor like
   `analytics/config.ts › validateProviderConfig` still resolves.
2. **Delete the symbol.** Only when nothing calls it at all, and only after you can say what it
   was for and where to get it back (name the file whose history holds it).
3. **Keep it, with a `notes` entry.** For the cases below.

Two hard blockers on 1 and 2, both of which have bitten:

- **`declaration: true` outranks the gate.** An exported `const x = new X()` cannot be emitted
  into the `.d.ts` if `X` is private to the module, and the same goes for a parameter or return
  type. So the class behind an exported `.getInstance()` singleton, and a constant another
  exported signature names with `typeof`, **must stay exported** however dead the name looks.
  `tsc --noEmit` does not catch this — only the build does, which is why it reaches CI.
- **A generated page can be the only consumer.** `META_TAG_SELECTORS` has no importer, yet its
  `meta[name="…"]` literals are extracted from the file's *text* into
  `core/guide/reference/meta-tags.md`; `core/debug/debug-module.ts` is cited by four generated
  pages precisely *because* nothing imports it. Before deleting, grep the symbol **and its
  string values** across `src/core/guide/`, `src/docs/` and `src/tests/docs/`, then run
  `npx vitest run src/tests/docs/` — the feature's own suite passes either way.

A helper whose only importer is a test is **test infrastructure**, not dead code. Say so in the
notes rather than deleting it.

## Type Definitions
- Global event types: `src/types/global.ts` → `EventMap`
- Campaign/package/product types: `src/types/campaign.ts`
- Cart types: `src/types/cart.ts`
- API request/response types: `src/types/api.ts`
- Add new shared types to these files; avoid inline `type` declarations for reused shapes

## Code Style
- 2-space indentation, semicolons, single quotes
- 80-character line width (Prettier enforced)
- Trailing commas (ES5 style)
- Arrow function parens: omit for single params (`x => x + 1`)
- Run `npm run format` after significant changes; `npm run type-check` before considering work done
