  End-to-end testing methodology for the Campaign Cart SDK — how to write a
  Playwright spec that proves a shopper-visible behaviour and cannot pass for the
  wrong reason. Load when adding or changing anything under e2e/, when a bug got
  past the unit suite, when a change touches what renders in the browser
  (enhancer DOM wiring, attributes, formatting, the debug overlay), or when
  deciding whether a behaviour belongs in Vitest or Playwright. Carries the
  fixture/stub harness API, the "prove it can fail" discipline, and the traps that have
  actually produced green-but-meaningless specs in this repo. Pairs with
  .claude/rules/e2e.md (policy) and .claude/rules/testing.md (unit conventions).

# SDK E2E

How to write a Playwright spec for this SDK that is worth the seconds it costs.

> **North star:** a unit test proves the *logic*; an E2E proves the **shopper sees
> it**. If your assertion would pass with the DOM disconnected, it is a unit test
> wearing a browser costume — move it to Vitest and save the runtime.

## 0. Does this belong in E2E at all?

| Question | Where it belongs |
|---|---|
| Does this function return the right value? | Vitest |
| Does this store transition correctly? | Vitest |
| Does the value reach the DOM through a real enhancer? | **E2E** |
| Does a real `navigator.*` / browser API feed it? | **E2E** |
| Does clicking this actually repaint? | **E2E** |
| Does it work in WebKit's ICU as well as Chromium's? | **E2E** |
| Is a `docs/guides/` markup example still correct? | **E2E** (see §3) |

`.claude/rules/testing.md` owns the Vitest side. Two standing entries there point
here: *"enhancer DOM wiring — covered by E2E"* and *"a test that needs real pixel
heights belongs in E2E"* (happy-dom does no layout, so `scrollHeight`,
`offsetHeight` and `getBoundingClientRect()` are all zero under Vitest).

**Do not port a passing unit test into E2E for extra confidence.** The suite runs
five browser projects; every duplicated assertion is paid for five times, forever.

## 1. The harness — use it, do not rebuild it

Everything lives in [`e2e/fixtures/routes.ts`](../../../e2e/fixtures/routes.ts).
Full API in [`references/harness.md`](./references/harness.md). The shape of every
spec:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { stubAll, bootSdk } from './fixtures/routes';

const FIXTURE = '/e2e/fixtures/my-feature.html';

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  await stubAll(page);
});

test('does the thing the shopper sees', async ({ page }) => {
  await bootSdk(page, FIXTURE);

  await expect(page.locator('#total')).toHaveText('$29.99');
});
```

Three rules that follow from how it is built:

- **The network is faked; the SDK is not.** `page.route` intercepts
  `campaigns.apps.29next.com`; the SDK itself is the real one Vite serves. A spec
  that mocks an SDK module is testing the mock.
- **Never let a spec reach the live backend.** No un-stubbed endpoint, ever — it
  makes the suite non-deterministic and depends on someone's test data.
- **`bootSdk` is the only correct wait.** It polls for `window.next.on`. A
  `waitForTimeout` instead is a flake with a delay fuse.

## 2. Async rendering: assert with locators, never with `textContent()`

Enhancers render after the store settles, so a one-shot read races them:

```ts
// ✗ reads once, usually before the enhancer has run
expect(await page.locator('#total').textContent()).toBe('$29.99');

// ✓ auto-retries until it matches or the timeout expires
await expect(page.locator('#total')).toHaveText('$29.99');
```

Same for counts and attributes — `toHaveCount`, `toHaveAttribute`, `toHaveClass`
all retry. For anything the harness cannot express, `expect.poll(...)`. There is
exactly one legitimate `waitForTimeout`: proving something **has not** happened,
and even then prefer asserting the stable end state.

## 3. The fixture is the example source

A fixture is the markup Playwright runs, so it is where a `docs/guides/` example
should be copied from: a snippet nobody runs is a snippet that rots. Nothing
extracts fixtures into the docs any more, so the copy is by hand, and the markup in
a fixture should be exemplary rather than minimal-to-pass. Real values, no
placeholder cruft.

## 4. Prove the test can fail

**A new spec is not done until you have watched it go red.** Revert the fix, run
it, see the failure, restore. This is the single highest-value habit in this file,
and it is not theoretical — it has caught, in this repo:

- **A vacuously green suite.** Eight `format-validator` assertions passed because
  the attribute the fixture set (`data-next-format`) was never read by the code
  under test — it only read the legacy `data-format`. Every test passed; none
  tested anything. A negative control (*"and this bad value IS reported"*) is what
  exposed it.
- **A tautological assertion.** `currency-formatter.test.ts` built its expected
  value through the same `Intl` call it was testing, so it could not fail. Assert
  the **observable property** (which side the symbol is on; which character
  separates the decimals), not a re-derivation of the implementation.
- **A test that only restated its own setup.** A locale test called `clearCache()`
  before asserting, so it proved `clearCache` worked rather than that the cache was
  keyed correctly. The real bug needed a locale change **without** a cache clear.

Add at least one **negative control** to any spec whose assertions are all
"something good appears" — a case where the feature must *not* fire.

## 4b. Nobody is watching the console

**No spec in this suite asserts on `console.error`.** That is how a malformed
shared stub went unnoticed while 446 tests stayed green: `stubCart` returns
`{ lines: [], totals: {} }`, which is not a `CartSummary` — it has no `subtotal` —
so `buildCartFields()` throws `[DecimalError] Invalid argument: undefined` on
**every cart sync**, the SDK catches it, logs it, and every spec that thinks it is
exercising API-calculated totals is exercising the error path instead.

So when a spec's subject touches the cart, the order, or anything that catches its
own failures, assert the absence of errors explicitly:

```ts
const errors: string[] = [];
page.on('console', m => { if (m.type() === 'error') errors.push(m.text()); });
page.on('pageerror', e => errors.push(String(e)));
// … drive the feature …
expect(errors).toEqual([]);
```

A caught-and-logged error is invisible to every other kind of assertion. If the
feature legitimately logs an error, assert the *expected* one rather than silence.

A cheap way to find these in bulk is a **seeded monkey**: drive random clicks and
inputs across every fixture with a fixed seed, collecting `pageerror` and
`console.error`. One was written and thrown away once it had found what it was
built to find — the traps below are what it cost to get there, and they are the
reason a throwaway one is worth writing again rather than kept running.

Reproducibility is the whole point — a finding you cannot replay is not
actionable. Four traps make a monkey lie. The first two produced phantom findings
before they were spotted; the last two made it *silently test nothing*, which is
worse, and both were found by neutering the fix and checking the monkey noticed:

- **`page.route('**/api/**')` also matches Vite serving `/src/api/client.ts`**,
  which then arrives as JSON and kills the module graph. Scope route globs to the
  real API prefix (`**/api/v1/**`).
- **Playwright checks routes in reverse registration order** — the last one added
  wins. A catch-all registered last silently swallows every specific stub before
  it. Register the catch-all *first*.
- **A stub answering two endpoints with one shape invents bugs.** The countries CDN
  has `/location` *and* `/countries/{CODE}/states`, and only the second carries
  `countryConfig`; answering both with the location shape made `updateFormLabels`
  throw a TypeError that read exactly like an SDK defect.
- **An empty cart makes half the SDK unreachable.** Express checkout returns at its
  `isCartEmpty` guard and its buttons render `disabled`, so a monkey that cannot
  fill a cart never reaches any order-creating path — and every invariant about
  them passes vacuously. Seed the cart after boot (`next.getCartCount()` then
  `next.addItem`, **not** `getCartData().totalQuantity`, which does not exist), and
  give the campaign stub `available_express_payment_methods` or no express button
  is rendered to click.

## 5. Traps specific to this SDK

- **`?debugger=true` mounts the debug overlay; `?debug=true` does not.** The latter
  only turns on AttributeScanner performance logging. Documented at the top of
  `e2e/debug.spec.ts`; costs an hour if rediscovered.
- **Playwright locators pierce open shadow roots.** The overlay, and each of its
  selectors, is a shadow host — `page.locator('#debug-locale-selector #locale-select')`
  just works. Do not hand-roll a recursive `shadowRoot` walk.
- **`window.nextConfig` must be set with `page.addInitScript`**, before
  `/src/index.ts` executes. Setting it in `page.evaluate` after `goto` is too late —
  config is read at boot step 2. Note it replaces the whole object, so the API key
  usually comes from the fixture's `<meta name="next-api-key">`.
- **Pin the browser locale with `test.use({ locale: 'en-US' })`** in any spec whose
  assertions contain a formatted number, date or price. The runner's default is not
  a contract, and a CI machine can differ from a laptop.
- **`Intl` separates a trailing currency symbol with U+202F**, a narrow no-break
  space — `toHaveText('29,99 €')` typed with an ASCII space fails. Use a regex with
  `\s`, which matches it.
- **ICU differs per engine.** Run formatting-sensitive specs on all five projects
  (`npx playwright test e2e/x.spec.ts`), not just `--project=chromium`.
- **The dev server is reused when already running** (`reuseExistingServer` unless
  CI) and readiness is a TCP check, because `GET /` is a 404 — the dev server has no
  root route.

## 6. Naming and layout

```
e2e/<feature>.spec.ts          one spec per feature, named for the feature
e2e/fixtures/<feature>.html    its fixture, same base name
e2e/fixtures/routes.ts         shared stubs + bootSdk + captureEvents
e2e/fixtures/campaign.ts       MINIMAL_CAMPAIGN / RICH_CAMPAIGN
e2e/fixtures/order.ts          TEST_ORDER
```

Vary a fixture campaign by spreading rather than adding a near-duplicate:

```ts
const EUR_CAMPAIGN: Campaign = { ...MINIMAL_CAMPAIGN, currency: 'EUR' };
```

Every spec opens with a comment saying **what behaviour it protects and why a unit
test cannot** — the same standard the rest of the repo holds prose to
(`.claude/rules/documentation.md` §2). Findings discovered while writing a spec go
in that header too; that is where the `?debugger=true` trap above is recorded.
