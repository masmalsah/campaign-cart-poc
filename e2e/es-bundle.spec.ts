/**
 * The built bundle loads, in a real engine, through the real loader.
 *
 * Every other spec here loads `/src/index.ts` — the source, served by Vite as one
 * module per file. Customers load something else entirely: `public/loader.js`
 * fetches `dist/index.js`, which imports the `dist/chunks/*` that `manualChunks`
 * carved out of the same source. Those chunk boundaries exist only in the built
 * artifact, and they are what broke in v0.4.31: a chunk cycle made `state`
 * initialise before the chunk holding `createLogger`, so evaluating the graph threw
 * `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'l' before initialization`
 * ([#77](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart/issues/77)).
 *
 * Nothing caught it, and the reason is the loader: its `catch` logs
 * `Failed to load SDK:` and loads `dist/index.umd.js` instead, so `window.next`
 * still appears, the page still works, and every assertion in every other spec
 * still passes. The only visible symptoms are a console error and a second bundle
 * download — which is why this spec asserts on exactly those two things rather than
 * on any shopper-visible behaviour.
 *
 * `src/tests/contract/es-bundle-init.test.ts` covers the same property in CI, which
 * does not run Playwright. It evaluates the graph under Node's ES-module semantics;
 * this spec is the half that proves five real engines agree, and that the loader
 * stayed on the module path. Both run the same list of boot conditions, because
 * what a module body does at init time depends on the URL: see `?debugger=true`
 * below and `BOOTS` there.
 *
 * **It tests the committed `dist/`, not your working tree.** Run `npm run build`
 * first, or you are re-testing the last artifact someone committed.
 *
 * The fixture loads `/public/loader.js`, not `/loader.js`, and Vite logs
 * `Instead of /public/loader.js, use /loader.js.` for it. Keep the longer path: the
 * loader looks for exactly that substring to decide it is running locally and to
 * point `PROD_HOST` at `/dist`. Served from `/loader.js` that branch misses and the
 * path falls out of a `substring(0, -1)`, which happens to work — a different code
 * path from the one this spec means to exercise.
