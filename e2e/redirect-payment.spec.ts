/**
 * Paying by a method that has no form and no express button — iDEAL, Bancontact,
 * SEPA, TWINT, Affirm, Link — which is
 * [issue #74](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart/issues/74).
 *
 * The shopper picks the radio, fills the same checkout form as everyone else, and
 * the order is created with that method on it. The API answers with a
 * `payment_complete_url`, and the SDK's job is to send them there to pay. Two
 * things can silently go wrong, and both did before this: the radio can be read
 * as a card, so the order goes out as a card; and the redirect can go to the
 * thank-you page, so the shopper never pays at all.
 *
 * Why this cannot be a unit test: what is being proved is the whole journey — a
 * real radio, a real form submit, the request the SDK actually posted, and the
 * URL the browser actually ended up at. happy-dom has one document and does not
 * navigate.
 *
 * Nothing here needs Spreedly: a redirect method collects no card, so the SDK
 * never builds its tokenizer (MINIMAL_CAMPAIGN ships an empty `payment_env_key`,
 * which is what decides that).
