/**
 * `dl_purchase` must describe a purchase that happened —
 * [issue #71](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart/issues/71).
 *
 * Express checkout creates the order *before* the shopper pays: the orders API
 * answers with a `payment_complete_url` and the SDK sends them to PayPal with it.
 * The purchase event used to be raised at that point and parked in
 * `sessionStorage`, so it fired on whatever page came next — including the
 * checkout page the shopper landed back on by pressing **back**. Eight such
 * events in one week at one merchant, four from sessions with no order at all,
 * and an affiliate network paid out on six of them.
 *
 * Why this cannot be a unit test: the bug lives in the *page transitions*. It
 * needs a real navigation away from the site, a real back-navigation, a second
 * real SDK boot, and the sessionStorage queue surviving all three. happy-dom has
 * one document and no history.
 *
 * The success leg is the negative control in reverse: it proves the fix did not
 * simply stop reporting purchases.
