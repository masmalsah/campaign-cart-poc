/**
 * `dl_purchase` on the **card** path, which is how most shoppers pay —
 * [issue #71](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart/issues/71).
 *
 * The express spec covers PayPal. This covers the two card journeys:
 *
 * - a card charged on the checkout page, which redirects straight to the
 *   thank-you page; and
 * - a card the bank sends to 3-D Secure first, which is the express-checkout
 *   shape wearing a card's clothes — the order exists before any money moves.
 *
 * Why this cannot be a unit test: the thing being proved is that the *redirect*
 * carries the order reference and that the page it lands on reports the purchase
 * exactly once. That needs a real form submit, a real navigation, and a second
 * SDK boot. happy-dom has one document and no history.
 *
 * Spreedly is stubbed rather than loaded: it is an off-site iframe tokenizer that
 * cannot run headless. That stub, the form-filling and the rest of the card
 * harness live in [`fixtures/card-checkout.ts`](./fixtures/card-checkout.ts),
 * shared with `checkout-overlay.spec.ts`. Everything after the token — order
 * creation, redirect, landing page — is the real SDK.
