/**
 * Builds one folder of the versioned docs site.
 *
 * A released tag is checked out into a throwaway `git worktree`, this checkout's
 * `node_modules` is linked into it, and TypeDoc runs there with `out` pointing at
 * `<site>/v<version>`. The worktree is removed afterwards, including on failure.
 * `--branch <name>` builds a branch tip the same way, into `<site>/<name>`.
 * `--dev` skips the worktree and builds the working tree into `<site>/dev`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/docs-build-version.mjs v0.4.30        # one released version
 *   node scripts/docs-build-version.mjs --branch main  # branch tip -> <site>/main
 *   node scripts/docs-build-version.mjs --dev          # working tree -> <site>/dev
 *   node scripts/docs-build-version.mjs v0.4.30 --out /tmp/site --base-url https://…
 *
 * Options:
 *   --branch <name>      Build that branch's tip into `<site>/<name>` — the unreleased
 *                        docs. Not a release, so it never becomes `latest/` and never
 *                        enters `versions.json`; the in-page switcher offers it by name
 *                        (see `docs/assets/site.js`).
 *   --dev                Build the working tree into `<site>/dev`. Never published.
 *   --out <dir>          Site root (default `docs/site`).
 *   --base-url <url>     Site root URL. Sets the selected theme's public URL to
 *                        `<url>/<folder>/` so canonical links and the sitemap point at
 *                        the version they belong to. Also read from `DOCS_BASE_URL`.
 *                        Omitted by default — hosting is undecided, and a wrong
 *                        canonical URL is worse than none.
 *   --floor <tag>        Oldest tag allowed (default `VERSION_FLOOR` in
 *                        `docs-versions.mjs`). Below it the build refuses.
 *   --skip-existing      Leave an already-built folder alone instead of rebuilding.
 *   --no-latest          Do not point `<site>/latest` at this build.
 *   --strict             Keep `validation.invalidLink` on for a tag build.
 *
 * Which `typedoc.json` decides what gets documented: the **ref's own**, whenever it has
 * one (v0.4.31 and up). Its `entryPoints` and `projectDocuments` are what the author saw
 * from `npm run docs` on that ref, so the published folder shows the same site they
 * previewed. Ignoring them is what published v0.4.35 with the old per-feature `guide`
 * sidebar and none of its `docs/guides` pages.
 *
 * Older tags carry no config of their own, and the layout moved under them
 * (`src/enhancers` -> `src/features`, `src/stores` -> `src/state`), so those fall back to
 * {@link LAYOUTS}. Everything else — theme, plugins, site chrome — always comes from this
 * checkout, so every folder on the site still looks like one site.
